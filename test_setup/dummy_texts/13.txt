Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is situated in the island of Luzon, at the
mouth of the river Pasig, which empties itself into the Bay of Manila. The city was
founded in 1571. In 1645 it was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake, in
which upwards of three hundred lives were lost. In 1863 a great part of the city was
again destroyed from the same cause, and in July, 1880, another terrible upheaval
again made wreck of a great portion of i t : the inhabitants are naturally in constant
fear of those visitations. The dwelling-houses are built with especial reference to
safety under such circumstances, and, although large, possess few pretensions to
architectural beauty. The streets, also, are narrow and but small attention has been
devoted to securing shade by the growth of trees. There are several ancient churches
which are worthy of notice. The cathedral, founded originally in 1578, has been
several times destroyed by earthquake and did not escape in 1863. It has been since
rebuilt, but again sustained considerable damage in 1880, when the tower was so
much shattered that it had to be pulled down. The city and its suburbs contain a
population of nearly 300,000 and are the seat of a considerable and yearly increasing
commerce. The principal articles of export are hemp, sugar, tobacco, cigars, coffee,
and indigo, while of the imports cotton goods form the chief item. Only a small
portion of the present city is enclosed within the walls. The anchorage is distant
some three miles from the shores. The river presents a scene of great animation,
being crowded with native craft interspersed with vessels of foreign build. The
passport system is in force and no one can enter or leave without previously obtaining a pass. Before, landing passengers are obliged to pull alongside a Custom-house
guard boat stationed near the landing place to prevent smuggling. The garrison of
Manila consists of one European and several native regiments. The police of the city
is also under military discipline and is composed of natives. A very low average of
crime is said to exist, but the native classes are much addicted to gambling, an
offence punishable by law, although the Government reaps a large portion of its revenue from the sale of lottery tickets. A race meeting is held in the spring, and usually
good sport is afforded. On the 20th October, 1882, a typhoon of almost unparalleled
severity swept over the city and surrounding district, doing enormous damage and
laying a great part of Manila in ruins. There are three daily papers, El Eiario
de Manila and La Oceania Espa√±ola, published in the morning, and El Comercio,
which appears in the evening. The hot season commences in March and continues
until July, when the rains commence and continue to December, during which time
the roads and streets get into a very bad condition. The maximum annual rainfall
recorded is 114 inches and the minimum 84 inches. The maximum of the thermometer is about 92, with a range of ten degrees during the twenty-four hours, a
cool sea breeze setting in at night and reducing the heat to an endurable temperature
for sleeping. According to the census of 1873 there were residing in Manila 250 foreigners of European origin, 4,189 European Spaniards, 15,157 Chinese, 46,066 Chinese
mestizos (or half-breeds), 3,849 Spanish mestizos, and 160,896 pure natives.
In 1882 the imports reached a value of $20,013,784, and the exports $14,579,347.
The complete official returns for 1883 have not yet been published, but from a table
published in a local papier it appears the export of hernp was 641,802 piculs, value
about $6,918,625; and the export of sugar 1,529,943 piculs, value $7,267,129. The
value of tobacco and cigars exported from the Philippines generally is given as -
$3,842,366.
