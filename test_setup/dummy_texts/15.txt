Osaka is the secoml city in Japan in point of size and commercial importance, and
lias not inaptly been termed the Venice of the Far East, owing to the manner in which
it is intersected by canals. The city is compact and well laid out, the streets being
regular, clean, and animated. Osaka is essentially Japanese, though a go-ahead and
progressive city, and possesses much of interest to the foreign visitor. It is situated in
the province of ttettsu, and is built on the banks of the river Aji, about five miles
from the sea. The river is only navigable for small vessels, and on the opening of the
railway to Kobe the foreign trade of Osaka commenced to decline. Almost all the
foreign firms which at one time were established in the latter city have removed to
Kobe. Hopes are very generally entertained in Osaka of a recovery of the cityâ€™s lost
position in this respect, and to that end a new harbour is being constructed to
accommodate ocean-going steamers. The most imposing and at the same time
the most interesting object to be seen in Osaka is the Castle, erected in 1583 by one
of the Shoguns, the famous Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Though less extensive than that of
Tokyo, it is a much grander and more striking edifice, and is indeed, next to that of Nagoya,
the finest example of the ancient feudal castles of Japan. It is now occupied by the Osaka
garrison, and forms the headquarters of one of the six great military districts, and it
has also within its inclosure an extensive military arsenal. The city is the seat of
the provincial government, which is called Fucho, in contradistinction to the other
provincial governments, which are termed Kenelm. Osaka is the seat of numerous
industries, including cotton spinning mills, shipbuilding yards, and iron works,
and the Imperial Mint is located there. This establishment is in active operation
and turns out a coinage not surpassed by any in the world. The imports in 1900
amounted to yen 9,741,436 against yen 6,390,913 in 1899 and the exports to yen 9,626,595
in 1900 against yen 5,939,290 in the previous year. The value of imports for 1902 was
yen 11,875,730 and exports yen 15,050,579. The figures for 1903 are Imports yen
16,506,488, and exports yen 18,394,998. The British and American residents, numbering
about 100, are, with few exceptions, missionaries.
