This protected Malay State, containing an area of 3,160 square miles, lies on the
western coast of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded by the Protected States of Perak
on the North and of Negri Sembilan on the south, extending inland to the mountains
in the centre of the peninsula, which divide it from Pahang.
The Government is administered by the Sultan, who is advised by the British
Resident and by the State Council. The State is divided into the following 
six districts:- 1.—Kutala Lumpur, containing the town of Kuala Lumpur, where the Residency
and principal Government Offices are situated, and which also contains the richest tin
mines that have yet been developed. 2.—Klang. This district contains the Sultan’s
residence and also Port Swettenham, the principal port, which lies at the mouth of the
Klang river. 3.—Kuala Langat, an agricultural district. 4.—Kuala Selangor, a coastal
district containing large areas of developed and potential padi land. 5.—Ulu Selangor,
a district adjoining Perak and Pahang, containing much valuable mining land. 6.—
Ulu Langat, an inland mining district on the borders of Negri Sembilan.
Each district is under the charge of a District Officer， from whom the Malay
Penghulus (in charge of the mukims into which each d istrict is sub-divided) receive
instructions.
The Police Force consists of 19 gazetted and superior officers, 997 subordinate police
officers and constables and 67 detectives.
The population of Selangor in 1884, when the first census was taken, was 46,568;
but at the end of 1938 it was estimated to be 664,847, of whom 314,927 were Chinese;
143,885 Malays, 191,782 natives of India, 3,844 Europeans, 2,496 Eurasians and 7,913
others.
The principal industries of the State, and those from which it derives the largest
portion of its revenue, are alluvial tin mining and rubber cultivation.
In addition to its rich mineral resources, the State possesses large tracts of land
well adapted for agriculture and the growth of staple products, such as rice and coconuts,
by small-holders. Pineapple cultivation is a recent and thriving occupation and mirror
plantations of coffee and pepper have been successfully conducted. To encourage
pioneer planters, grants of land have (in recent years) been made, on special terms, for
the planting of African oil palm and nipah palm. But the principal agricultural product
here, as in the other Malay States, is rubber. 746,337 acres of land had been
alienated for agricultural and building purposes by the end of the year 1938 comprising 
511,977 acres under rubber, 117,905 acres under coconuts, 8,148 acres under coffee,
15,646 acres under padi, 21,404 acres under oil palm and 24,536 acres under cultivation
by native small-holders. The value of rubber exported in 1938 was $35,356,682.
The principal exports are rubber, tin, pineapples, copra and oil palm products.
The principal imports are rice, petroleum, oils, cotton piece goods, manufactured food
stuffs, tobacco and livestock.
There were 52,591 acres alienated for mining — chiefly tin — at the end of 1938. The
recorded output of tin concentrate from the State amounted to 281,112 pikuls as compared 
with 546,834 pikuls in 1937. The value of this output at the average local price
of tin of $95,59 per pikul was $19,836,917 as against a total value of $49,047,005 at an
average price of $110.79 for 1937. The Malayan Collieries, Limited, turned out 477,908
tons of coal against 627,890 tons in 1937. The quality of the coal is reported to be
excellent.
There is frequent and regular communication, by means of coasting steamers,
between the Straits Settlements and Selangor. From Kuala Lumpur the chief town on
the mainland, a network of excellent arterial roads covers the State and extends into
the neighbouring States of Perak, Negri Sembilan and Pahang while branch lines of
railway link the territory on the west to the main trunk line which passes through
Selangor.
