The usual residence of the Governor-General is at Buitenzorg, at a distance
of nearly one hour by railway from Batavia. The botanical gardens near the
palace of the Governor-General were made in 1817, and are well known not only
for their beautiful arrangement, but especially for the great services rendered to
science and agriculture under the management of the eminent directors, Teysmann,
Dr. Scheffer, and Prof. Dr. Treub. All experiments for the introduction of exotic plants
into Netherlands-India are made here, with the result that many useful plants from
foreign countries are reared and flourish in Java as in their native soil.
